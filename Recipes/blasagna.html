    <h4>Instructions</h4>
        <ol style="width: 50%;">
            <li>In a large pot over medium high heat, drizzle the olive oil in an thin layer across the bottom. Heat until the olive oil is shimmering. Add the meatballs to the pot and sear on all sides, until browned evenly. It's okay if the meatballs are not cooked through. Remove the meatballs from the pot and set aside.</li>
            <li>Without cleaning the pot, add the onions and saute until tender, about 5 minutes. Then add the green peppers and cook until just browned, another 4-5 minutes.</li>
            <li>Stir in the tomato paste. Cook for 4-5 minutes, until the tomato paste is mixed into the onions and peppers. Deglaze the pot with a splash of apple cider vinegar.</li>
            <li>Add the minced garlic and cook another 2-3 minutes, until the garlic is fragrant. Stir in the paprika, basil, oregano and thyme.</li>
            <li>Pour the tomato sauce and diced tomatoes into the pot. Heat 4-5 minutes until just simmering. Season generously with salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Break the lasagna noodles into the pot. Stir until the pieces are coated in the tomato sauce. Return the meatballs to the pot. Then pour in the beef broth.</li>
            <li>Bring to a rolling simmer and cook for 15-20 minutes, until the noodles are just al dente.</li>
            <li>When the noodles are al dente, stir in the cottage cheese until it is melty. Continue to cook simmer on medium heat until the noodles are cooked tender, another 15-20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Ladle the soup into individual crocks. Sprinkle an even layer of cheese over the top of the soup. Place two slices of mozzarella (or however many it takes to cover the top of the crock) on top. Broil for 5-10 minutes on the lowest broil setting, until the mozzarella is golden, bubbly and melted.</li>
            <li>Cool the crocks for 15 minutes prior to serving. Garnish the soup with fresh basil leaves and serve with crusty french bread. Enjoy!</li>
